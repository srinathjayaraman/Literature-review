# LITERATURE SURVEY OVERVIEW

Over the course of my conversation with Dr. Liem, I arrived at the following structure and procedure to be followed for my literature survey.

- The "theme" of this survey is **context aware music recommender systems**.
- A historical timeline or chronology of such context aware recommender systems isn't an ideal approach here.
- Clusters of context and what they mean is a better option.
- Compare different contexts and how they differ from each other - location, time, etc.
- Try to stitch together the different papers I come across.
- Build a larger narrative/storyline.
- I want to understand the methodology of different recommender systems - this might necessitate a comparison of how different papers treat location as a context for instance.
- There needs to be some kind of coherent clustering/aggregation when it comes to context aware systems, such as:
    - Main strategies that are followed
    - What kind of information is taken into account
    - Taxonomy of the recommender systems
- Understand the mindset and approach behind a particular methodology.
- Understand the **purpose** of this methodology - why did they not go for a diferent perspective, a different model or formula, etc.
- _**At least**_ 30 to 40 papers have to be referenced
    - If I am not able to meet this minimum limit, it is worth expanding the scope of this survey
    - One possibility is to do a comparison of how time and  location are treated in a different recommender system context - tourism, movies, etc.
- Make sure my citations are legitimate - there is a lot of crap out there!
- Conferences and journals are a good starting point since they typically have higher standards
- Workshop papers need to be looked at more critically since they are still a work in progress
- If a paper has been cited a lot of times, that is a good sign, but it's not a hard measure. A few rules of thumb are:
    - Make sure it's not just the author repeatedly citing their own work
    - Ensure that there are a diverse set of citations
    - The more journals and conferences a paper is cited in, the better it is (generally)
- If I find a paper that seems interesting and innovative, but is not cited all that much, then I should try to find out why this is the case. 
- If there is a very well written and sourced blogpost or news article, it is worth taking into consideration as well.
- Use my own discretion and understanding when it comes to deciding why a publication gets cited or not.
